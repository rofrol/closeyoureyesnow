# Close Your Eyes Now

This the combinations of techniques to get into bed at 22:00 and fall asleep in short time.

I am sharing this for the greater benefit of humanity.

After reading this, I thought about [scene in the sleeping pod from The Fifth Element (1997)](https://youtu.be/UENRVfdnGxs?t=53):

![](/frontend/static/TheFifthElement1997TakeoffScene.gif)

After pressing the button you fall asleep instantly.

How can we have similar device today? Or similar effect with some techinque?

It looks like we can have it.

## Works for me

I am applying below techniques on myself, and it works since 2019-11-13 so 7 nights already.

## Alarms

First you need to set two alarms with snooze options disabled. Screenshots are from ios.

When the first alarm rings, prepare very quickly. 5 minutes is very shor time.

So when the second alarm rings, you must immediately close your eyes. If you haven't finished washing your teeth or drinking water, do it with your eyes closed. No excuses.

## Attitude

You need to want to fall a asleep. Otherwise you coul lay in your bad awake for several hours like me. If you have this attitude, you can apply next techniques.

## Meditation

According to [Sadhguru - Learn How To Sleep Correctly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3soroEZ3yBk) you need to:

- Sleep with your head directed to East (best) or West (good). North and South are very bad.
- Repeat: when you inhale say in your mind "This is not my body", when you exhale "This is not my mind".

I'm not sure if this direction helps, but this mantra definitelly helps me.

I am also focusing on my breath.

I am using here Vipassana Meditation which I learnt from [Mindfulness in Plain English by Ven. Henepola Gunaratana](http://www.vipassana.com/meditation/mindfulness_in_plain_english.php). [PDF](http://misc.equanimity.info/downloads/mindfulness_in_plain_english.pdf). [Polish translation](http://sasana.wikidot.com/medytacja-vipassana-w-prostych-slowach) in web, pdf, epub formats.

## Relax your body

This the technique I more or less use to relax my body:

1. Sit back in your chairs and put your feet flat on the deck. Knees apart, your hands limp on the inside of your lap. Now, close your eyes and drop your chin until it rests on your chest.
2. Let’s breathe slowly, deeply, and regularly. Take all the wrinkles out of your forehead. Relax your scalp. Just let go. Now let your jaw sag-g-g. Let it drop open. Now relax the rest of your face muscles. Get the brook trout look on your face. Even relax your tongue and lips. Just let them go loose. Breathe slowly.
3. Now, let’s go after the eight muscles that control your eyes. Let them go limp in their sockets. No focus, just let them go limp. Breathe slowly.
4. Now drop your shoulders as low as they will go. You think that they are low, but let them go more.  Did you feel the muscles in the back of your neck go limp? When you think you are really relaxed, let them go even more.
5. Now, let’s relax your chest. Take a deep breath. Hold it. Exhale and blow out all your tensions. Just let your chest collapse. Let it sag-g-g. Imagine you are a big, heavy blob on the chair, a jellyfish. Breathe slowly. When you exhale, release more and more of your tensions.
6. Let’s go after your arms. Talk directly to your arm muscles. First, talk to your right bicep. Tell it to relax, go limp. Do the same to your right forearm. Now to the right hand and fingers. Your arm should feel like a dead weight on your leg. Repeat the relaxation process with your left arm. Breathe slowly.
7. Your entire upper body has been exposed to relaxation and a warm, pleasant feeling comes over you. You feel good. A sense of well-being invades your body.
8. Now for your lower body. Talk to your right thigh muscles. Let them go to a dead weight on the chair. Let the meat hang on the bones. Go through the same routine for the right calf muscles. Then all the muscles of your right ankle and foot. Tell yourself that your right leg has no bones in it. It is just a flabby, heavy weight on the deck. Repeat the process with your left thigh, calf, ankle, and foot.
9. At present you are all relaxed physically, or think you are. For a little insurance, let’s take three deep breaths and when you let them out, blow out all the remaining tensions, one . . . whoosh, two . . . whoosh, three . . . whoosh.
10. You should relax every part of you body. Concentrating your focus on every part of your body one by one, and trying to relax it.

Shorter version:

1. Relax your entire face, including the muscles inside your mouth.
2. Drop your shoulders to release the tension and let your hands drop to the side of your body.
3. Exhale, relaxing your chest.
4. Relax your legs, thighs, and calves.
5. Clear your mind for 10 seconds by imagining a relaxing scene.
6. If this doesn’t work, try saying the words “don’t think” over and over for 10 seconds.
7. Within 10 seconds, you should fall asleep!

## Sleeping on the back

I try to sleep on my back because I have some problems with neck after many years of working sitting behind computer.

It is not easy if you previously was sleeping in different position.

## When you wake during night

If you wake up before sleeping 8 hours or similar for you, or you are not sure how long have you slept, ask Siri "What's the time?" or Google Assistant or Alexa or Cortana or whatever.

But do not open eyes until you are sure you have slept enought.

## Green tea better than coffee

I try to not drink coffee. If I need to wake up mysefl, I just drink green tea more frequently. Or infuse more leaves in a cup.

## Eating

I try to eat big breakfast and do not eat after 20:00.

## When I need short nap during day

I try to sleep in my chair so the nap is uncomfortable and I do not sleep to much. 5-10 minutes is ok to revitalize. Similar technique:

>Painter Salvador Dali and inventor Thomas Edison both actively worked with it. After a round of focused work, Dali sat on his arm chair to think and doze off. In one hand he held a big key and the moment he fell asleep the key dropped, which woke him up and so he went back to the canvas to continue his focused work. Steve Jobs broke up his daily thinking routine by going out for long walks.

## Extreme night owls

Scientists studied 21 "extreme night owls" who were going to bed, on average, at 02:30 and not waking until after 10:00.

Their instructions were to:

- Wake up 2-3 hours earlier than usual and get plenty of outdoor light in the morning
- Eat breakfast as soon as possible
- Exercise only in the morning
- Have lunch at the same time every day and eat nothing after 19:00
- Banish caffeine after 15:00
- Have no naps after 16:00
- Go to bed 2-3 hours earlier than usual and limit light in the evenings
- Maintain the same sleep and wake times every day

After three weeks, people had successfully shifted their body clocks two hours earlier in the day, the analysis by the University of Birmingham, University of Surrey and Monash University showed.

The results, in the journal Sleep Medicine, showed people still got the same hours of shut-eye.

But they reported lower levels of sleepiness, stress and depression, while tests showed their reaction times also improved.

## Sleep is your super power

>One of my most controversial software opinions is that your sleep quality and stress level matter far, far more than the languages you use or the practices you follow. Nothing else comes close: not type systems, not TDD, not formal methods, not ANYTHING.

https://twitter.com/hillelogram/status/1119709859979714560

By reanalyzing the data, she and her colleagues made two key findings. First, they found that the volunteers’ performance improved primarily during the short rests, and not during typing. The improvements made during the rest periods added up to the overall gains the volunteers made that day. Moreover, these gains were much greater than the ones seen after the volunteers returned the next day to try again, suggesting that the early breaks played as critical a role in learning as the practicing itself.

Second, by looking at the brain waves, Dr. Bönstrup found activity patterns that suggested the volunteers’ brains were consolidating, or solidifying, memories during the rest periods. Specifically, they found that the changes in the size of brain waves, called beta rhythms, correlated with the improvements the volunteers made during the rests.

Further analysis suggested that the changes in beta oscillations primarily happened in the right hemispheres of the volunteers’ brains and along neural networks connecting the frontal and parietal lobes that are known to help control the planning of movements. These changes only happened during the breaks and were the only brain wave patterns that correlated with performance.

“Our results suggest that it may be important to optimize the timing and configuration of rest intervals when implementing rehabilitative treatments in stroke patients or when learning to play the piano in normal volunteers,” said Dr. Cohen. “Whether these results apply to other forms of learning and memory formation remains an open question.”

Dr. Cohen’s team plans to explore, in greater detail, the role of these early resting periods in learning and memory.

## Yoga Nidra

The powerful and dynamic technique of Yoga Nidra, or inner conscious relaxation, which is also known as conscious sleep, or the Yogi's sleep.

Being relaxed is essential for sleep. If you are in any state of tension, feel irritable, worried, have too much on your mind, are pressured or unable to cope, then it is very hard for either the body or mind to let go and be at ease. Yoga Nidra is a deep relaxation technique that has been used for thousands of years to release unconscious inner layers of tension and trauma, whether physical, mental or emotional. Through the practice you are able to tap into a place of peace that leads to an easeful sleep.

In this way you will feel more refreshed than after many hours of sleep. Eventually, being relaxed and peaceful will permeate everything you do. Your mind will be come clearer and decisions are easier, problems are solved more simply, you can cope with whatever is being asked of you, you will be more content and will sleep more deeply. And all that equals more joy, happiness, and love.

What is unique about this practice, and what differs it from other relaxation methods, is the sankalpa or resolve. The practice both begins and ends with repeating this positive affirmation, a short statement clarifying your intent. This is not just about giving up smoking or losing weight, although it can be used for this purpose, but invites you to focus on a deeper purpose.

It is important that your resolve feels right for you, as you will use it each time you practice until it has become an integrated expression of your being. Keep it short and clear. Here are a few suggestions for making a resolve, either to help you sleep or to uplift your life, but we urge you to create your own.

- I will sleep peacefully and deeply
- I release the day and calmly enter into a time of deep sleep
- I am worthy and beautiful, and I have abundant resources and inner strength
- I am filled with love and compassion

After making the resolve, the practice continues with a rotation of awareness through each part of the body. In this way, you are connecting your body, emotions and mental awareness into a unified whole. This rotation of consciousness is important as it relaxes each part of the brain; it is through this rotation that you are able to relax so completely.

It is important not to judge yourself. It does not matter if you are unable to relax, or if you just lie there thinking for the whole session. During Yoga Nidra you maintain a stream of unbroken awareness. Just stay with the practice and be patient -- you are not dong the practice in order to create more tension!

Practice for as long as feels comfortable for you, whether it is for 10 or 30 minutes. It is more important that you do it regularly than for how long. You can do it at any time of the day. Lie with your back on the ground or on your bed with your arms parallel to your body with palms up, legs slightly apart, eyes closed with a pillow under you head and a blanket covering you. Breathe in and out naturally through your nose.

If you are doing it in bed at night when you are ready to sleep, then have your palms facing downward. You may even fall asleep before you complete the practice, which is fine. We have given instructions below, but we also have a CD available from our website: www.edanddebshapiro.com

### Practice: Yoga Nidra

Lying on your back, become aware of your breathing and watch your natural breath as it enters and leaves. Begin to relax as you breathe, letting go of tension on the out breath, breathing in easefulness on the in breath.

Now create a positive affirmation, something that is meaningful to you, such as: My body is relaxed ... my mind is calm ... my heart is open and loving. Silently repeat your affirmation three times. Now mentally relax your body by slowly visualizing each part. Bring your attention to your right foot, tighten the muscles, hold, then let go and relax your foot. Do the same with the whole of your right leg ... then the left foot ... and the left leg. Shake both legs, they are relaxed and at ease. Now move to the buttocks ... tightening, holding and releasing. Keep breathing. Slowly continue up your back ... the lower back ... middle back ... upper back ... tightening, holding and releasing, letting go with the out breath. Feel your back sinking into the ground, releasing, relaxing.

Now bring you attention to your abdomen ... tightening and letting go ... to the chest ... take a deep breathe and release it, relaxing your chest completely. Bring your attention to your right hand ... your right arm ... right shoulder, tensing and relaxing. Then to your left hand ... left arm ... left shoulder ... tightening, holding and releasing. Shake both arms and let them completely relax. Now bring attention to your neck ... relaxing ... to your face ... tensing and letting go ... and then to the whole of your head... tightening and relaxing. Feel your whole body releasing and letting go with each out breath. Now imagine you are sitting in a beautiful garden, a place where you feel safe and nurtured. The heat of the sun is warm, you can hear the sound of wild bird song all around you and smell the sweet scent of the flowers. Allow the ease and beauty of this place to soothe you, feel replenished and renewed by nature. Breathe gently, let the visualization fade.

Now repeat the affirmation you made at the beginning, three times. Then take a deep breath and let it go. Begin to externalize your awareness, become aware of your surroundings, roll over on your side and slowly sit up if you want to. Have a good stretch, have a smile on your face and give yourself a hug!
